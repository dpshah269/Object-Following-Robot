# Object-Following-Robot
This project is very compressive, easy to make and very good to watch. This robot brained with ARDUINO UNO, which is a microcontroller controlling the ultrasonic sensor and motors to move accordingly when the sensor senses any object between a distance of 25cm it follows and beyond that it will avoid. It is very nice to watch a robot following an object and going away in reality. 

# Connections
trig pin is connected to arduino 2pin

echo pin is connected to arduino 3pin

motordriver l293d have 16pin...

1,8,9,16pin of l293d is connected to +5v

4,5,10 and 11 pin of l293d is connected to gnd

so..

2pin of l293d is connect to 4pin of arduino

7pin of arduino is connect to 5pin of arduino

9pin of arduino is connect to 6pin of arduino

15pin of arduino is connect to 7pin of arduino

motor1 is connected to 3 and 6pin of l293d

motor2 is connected to 10 and 14 pin of l293d

that's it....then connect to power supply....
